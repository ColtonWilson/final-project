## Challenges
One challenge I faced with this project is getting the pictures to align correctly and be the same dimensions. It took some playing around with flexbox, but I was able to correctly get them all in the same place. 
The second challenege I faced was getting the contact page to adjust accordingly to the size of the screen. This allows the 'Drop Me a Message' to expand and shrink according the the view screen. This became more of a tedious challenege as it was simply accounting for each screen size.
